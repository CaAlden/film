description: A quick burb about why I made this blog
---
This is a blog that I‚Äôve wanted to start for a long time! I create it with two goals in mind.
First, I want to jot down and share my thoughts about movies as I have them. I normally have a pretty clear opinion about movies right after I watch them, but then cannot remember clearly all the little things I was thinking after about a week. I hope to use this blog to track those ideas while they‚Äôre still fresh.

Secondly, I find myself recommending lots of movies, but typically it‚Äôs after the point where I‚Äôve lost track of why I really liked the movie in the first place. I can talk vaguely about the themes or ‚Äúthis one scene where‚Ä¶‚Äù, but I‚Äôve always thought it would be nice to have a carefully considered blog post I could throw at someone when I make a recommendation.

## Wait a minute, who _are_ you?
I suspect virtually everyone looking at this blog will have been sent here by me directly, but if on the off chance you stumbled here from some freak accident of SEO, you may be wondering who I am or why I‚Äôm qualified to be making movie recommendations.

If that‚Äôs the case, welcome! My name is Campbell and I‚Äôm an American software engineer living in Tokyo. In my free time I play chess and watch movies. That‚Äôs where my qualifications start and end üòÖ. I‚Äôve seen a lot of films, but you should take my recommendations here for what they are: a friend‚Äôs biased opinion about films that are rarely if ever based in actual knowledge of the craft of filmmaking.

My goal, at the end of the day is to help you decide to watch (or skip) a movie you have been thinking about seeing. I also want to spark some ideas about some of the movies I love. Formal review is not the target.
