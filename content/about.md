description: A quick burb about why I made this blog
---
This is a blog that I've wanted to start for a long time! I create it with two goals in
mind.

First, I want to jot down and share my thoughts about movies as I have them. I normally have a pretty clear
opinion and thoughts about movies after I watch them, but then cannot remember clearly all the little things
I was thinking after about a week. I hope to use this blog to track those ideas while they're still fresh.

Secondly, I find myself recommending movies a lot but often it's after the point where I've lost track of why
I really liked the movie in the first place. I can talk vaguely about the things I liked, but I've always thought
it would be nice to have a blog post I could throw at someone when I make a recommendation.

Maybe someday if people find this and like my ideas, I can share these thoughts and recommendations more publicly!
For now, I hope you can find something useful or interesting in what I write.
