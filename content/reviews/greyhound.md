# Recommendation

I don't have a lot of deep thoughts on this film, but I wanted to put down a short, spoiler-free recommendation since I enjoyed it. _Greyhound_ is a small scale war story that centers on the events of an Atlantic crossing during WWII. The film is short (around 90 minutes) and the action and tension are constant so at no point does it overstay its welcome.

The stakes are smaller than many war films: only the ships in one convoy, but the focus throughout is on a single captain's decision making. This smaller sense of scale makes the movie feel more grounded in reality, and paints a clearer picture of how those decisions impact the lives of his men and the non-military vessels under his protection.

The film does not glorify or condemn the captain's choices. Instead, it poses a number of difficult moral questions and shows how his choices lead to consequences: good and bad. 

I would only not recommend this to people that find combat movies uninteresting as that's a large chunk of what you're getting. If you enjoy that, then this film also has character drama to go with it and the story is grounded
enough that it's not hard to empathize with.
